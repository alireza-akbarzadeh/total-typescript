# Become the TypeScript Wizard at Your Company

Total TypeScript is suitable for any developer who is ready to work at becoming a wizard, though some basic familiarity with TypeScript is recommended.

The Type Transformations workshop begins by warming you up with exercises on basic inference and essential types.

Then nearly 150 exercises later, the Advanced TypeScript Patterns workshop will have you creating chainable method abstractions with generics and the builder pattern.

Check out the free <a href="https://totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript">Beginner's Tutorial</a> to set a foundation and get an idea for the workshop's teaching approach.

## Type Transformations

### Wield the power of transformation to move from one type to another with ease

Many problems in TypeScript come down to transforming types into other types.

This workshop is your first step on the path to wizardry with topics including unions, template literals, conditional types and mapped types. You'll also see how to take advantage of inference and type helpers to ensure you retain flexibility while ensuring your types are exactly how you expect them to be.

## TypeScript Generics

### Unlock amazing inference in the functions you create and the abstractions you build

Generics are one of TypeScript's most complex and intimidating features.

Getting good at generics requires deep knowledge of the TypeScript Compiler, as well as an understanding of how their placement impacts their usefulness.

You'll practice with using generics in a variety of situations, as well as how to use function overloads when generics aren't the best fit.

## Advanced TypeScript Patterns

### Become fluent in TypeScript's undocumented patterns

The TypeScript community has discovered and iterated upon several patterns that build on the type transformation and generics techniques explored in the earlier workshops.

Here you'll grow more powerful through practice with branded types and the builder pattern, among others. You will also discover the best practices for strongly typing the global scope and how to understand the flow of generics through external libraries.

## Advanced React with TypeScript

### Expert-level knowledge for typing your React apps with TypeScript

Using TypeScript with React can be tricky, requiring flexible, type-safe, and structured components.

This workshop empowers developers to combine React and TypeScript effectively. It covers advanced props handling, leveraging TypeScript generics for components and hooks, safer React hooks using types, understanding the TypeScript type system, recognizing industry-standard patterns, and safely integrating external libraries into React components.
